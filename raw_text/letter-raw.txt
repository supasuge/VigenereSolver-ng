Alright—let’s do this the right way: savage, dark, raunchy, and funny without punching down on anyone’s body. The target is the King’s excess, gluttony, corruption, and ridiculous court culture. No coddling. No kid gloves. Just a roaring, scandalous petition written in an overstuffed, mock-medieval style with plenty of modern venom. Here you go.

# A Most Insolent Petition to His Most Fêted Majesty, Sovereign of the Seven Side-Dishes, Warden of the Wine-Cellar, Baron of Bottomless Brunches, & Self-Crowned Emperor of the Endless Entrée

**To His Radiantly Overindulged Majesty,**

May your banners be ever oiled, your trumpeters never run out of spit, and your kitchen fires never grow cold—though, by the smell of it, *that last one has never been a risk*. We, your faithful, famished, and frankly fed-up subjects, do hereby present this **Large and Volcanically Impolite Letter**, petition, screed, complaint, roast, manifesto, bar-room rant, and laundry list of grievances regarding Your Majesty’s courtly bacchanals, which have eaten the state down to the bones and then scribbled **“more, please”** on the marrow.

Permit us, O Crowned Connoisseur of Carb-Loading, to speak clearly, loudly, and without the usual ritual bows that only serve to crack our spines: **your court is a buffet that never ends, your government is a napkin tucked permanently into its collar, and your policy is gravy.** We cannot live on gravy. We have tried. It turns out you require bread.

You style yourself “Defender of the Realm.” From what we can see, Your Majesty, you are primarily defending the realm from ever experiencing leftovers.

## I. On the State of the Kingdom (Or, Why Is the Treasury Smelling Like Roast?)

Your Majesty, the kingdom is held together with kitchen twine. Each proclamation arrives butter-stained. Edicts are garnished. In the capital, the cobblestones have been polished smooth by the passing of servants hauling silver-domed platters large enough to serve a trebuchet. The royal heralds have developed a cough from announcing courses as if they were campaigns—“**Behold! Course the Third: A daring raid on the orchard tart!**”—and the populace has started laying bets on whether the ***soufflé*** will rise faster than the taxes.

Out in the villages, we ration candle-ends and stories. The rivers carry upstream the aroma of your delicacies as if every trout is born pre-basted. Our grain reserves are now “reserved” in the sense that a gambler reserves winnings he never had. The Royal Accountant can no longer count; he only performs caloric arithmetic. Three estates are mortgaged to the Pork Council. The Master of Coin is now also the Master of Marinades and, conveniently, the **Baron of Bankruptcy**.

Meanwhile, Your Majesty’s knights return from the tournaments not with honor or plunder, but with indigestion and commemorative napkins (monogrammed, embossed, gold-threaded, and edible—**because of course they are**). The Royal Falconer reports the hawks have given up hunting and simply wait near the banquet hall’s waste barrels like feathery, judgmental cats.

You cannot build a nation out of menu poetry and champagne burps. We require laws, courts, grain, order—by which we do not mean “course order.”

## II. The Court of the Grand Gorge (A Bestiary of Banqueters)

Let us catalog, briefly, this menagerie of courtiers fattened on curry and compliments:

* **The Lord Steward of Spillage**, whose cloak bears the heraldry of stains from five kingdoms. He speaks of “logistics,” by which he means “forks.”
* **The High Chronicler of Cheeses**, who writes history exclusively in rind and insists that the treaty of Rivergate was a **“very mature affair, a bit tangy, notes of oak.”**
* **The Master of Revels**, a man who, if forced to choose between a riot in the streets and a shortage of saffron, would **personally** set the streets on fire to protect the spice.
* **The Physician Royal**, who prescribes naps and custard to everything from plague to politics, and who has declared—after much study—that the surest cure for famine is to move the banquet to a different wing where the hungry cannot see it.
* **The Lord Chancellor of Candied Lies**, whose arguments stick to the roof of your mouth and who can sweet-talk a ledger into pretending it’s a harvest.

Even the **jester** looks exhausted—a professional clown who cannot compete with the accidental, catastrophic comedy of a cabinet that thinks “**food security**” means building a moat out of consommé.

The **knights** have traded lances for carving knives—“less blood, more jus”—and the **bishops** have quietly revised their liturgy: **“Give us this day our daily debt forgiveness and forgive us our lean years as we forgive those who re-sauce against us.”** The choir now hums hymns in the key of indigestion. The incense smells faintly of truffle.

---

## III. Dark Laughter at a Dark Table (Because We’re Beyond Polite Irony)

We would love to compose you a delicate sonnet of gentle rebuke. Instead, you get **the truth**, thrown like a tankard.

When the plague cart rattled through South Ward last winter, the bell rang in counterpoint to your spoons. We counted the chimes. They matched your courses. That is not symbolism; it is synchronization. Do you know how **ridiculously bleak** that is? It would make a poet quit words and take up bricklaying just to stop thinking.

You have turned governance into a tasting menu. Everything small, everything curated, everything plated in a way that looks good to sycophants and costs a fortune, and the people eat *pictures* of food posted on the city walls like **culinary propaganda**. “Look upon the pheasant, ye hungry, and despair.” Cool. Very inspiring. **We ate the poster. It tasted like glue and royal denial.** Pairs well with austerity.

We are not asking for much. We would like our fields not to be repossessed by the Guild of Spatulas. We would like the castle not to order our village bell as a novelty cloche. We would like the road to the mill to be paved with something other than **dropped profiteroles**. They are treacherous underfoot.

## IV. A Small Catalogue of Absurdities We Are No Longer Pretending Are Normal

1. **The Royal Alarm is a Dinner Gong.** When the watch rings it, the guard shows up carrying forks.
2. **The Mint Smells Like Syrup.** Coins are stamped sticky. Every purse is a trap for ants. The economy hums, literally.
3. **The Royal Menagerie Ate the Diplomatic Gifts.** We are not joking. The ambassador from the South brought spice-peacocks; your peacocks ate theirs. This started a war, which your generals renamed “Seasoning the Borders.”
4. **The Navy is Now a Floating Tapas Bar.** The Admiral’s flagship is called *The Appetizer*. Our enemies call it *The Hors d’Oeuvre* and plan to devour it.
5. **Justice Wears a Bib.** Sentences are measured in spoons. Appeals come with a palate cleanser. The judge bangs a peppermill instead of a gavel.
6. **The Treasury Accounts Are Written on Edible Paper.** This was touted as an innovation in efficiency. We call it **“Diet Accountability.”**
7. **The Royal Map has Stains Where the Kitchen Sits.** Important towns were erased during a discussion of sauces. We now navigate by aroma. “Two leagues past the rosemary, then due onion.”

We could go on (and will, because **do you see how ridiculous this has become?**), but you’re probably already waving for the next course.

## V. The Banquet as Warfare (How You’ve Weaponized Appetite)

Every tyrant invents a favorite weapon: iron, fire, God, the market. Yours is the knife-and-fork. You disarm dissent with canapés, bribe consciences with chocolate, smother questions in béchamel. We, poor fools, allowed ourselves to be impressed by the choreography of it all—an army of servers advancing like a glittering brigade while policy withered on the vine.

Royal councils now convene as the **Council of Tasting Notes**. Strategy is paired with citrus. Budgets are described as **mouthfeel**: “light, airy debt; **whipped liabilities**; a **silky deficit** with a long finish.” We are beyond parody; parody gave up and joined the kitchen staff for a steady wage and access to soup.

The most dangerous thing you ever learned wasn’t swordplay, Majesty; it was that **people go quiet when they’re chewing**. You realized you could feed the noise out of the room. Command by calorie. Edict by entrée. Promise dessert, and no one asks what happened to breakfast.

---

## VI. Raunchy Realities (Because the Palace Pretends Clean Linens Make Clean Hands)

Courtiers slip into corners like cats that swallowed entire creamery carts. Scandal is a side dish. Every affair is **dusting of sugar** on rot. The palace laundresses tell tales—the sort that would curl a monk’s eyebrows off—and it’s not the sex that scandalizes (we’re peasants, not nuns), it’s the **scale**. Ten people in a pantry. A harpsichord used as a table. A treaty signed on a naked back because the table was “busy with quince.”

Your Majesty, **we don’t care who kisses who**. Kiss the entire orchestra for all we care. What we care about is **what you’re doing while the kissing happens**: torching budgets, trading ministries like hors d’oeuvres, drooling over new cutlery while the roof of the west orphanage leaks like a polite waterfall. The court’s motto appears to be **“What happens in the pastry kitchen stays out of the records.”** Convenient, if sticky.

You have weaponized spectacle. You can sell sin as long as it’s plated. You can sell negligence as long as it’s flambéed. You can sell slow ruin as long as it glitters as it goes down.

---

## VII. “Let Them Eat Metaphor” (How Philosophy Became a Menu and the Menu Became Law)

Philosophers now submit scrolls with tasting flights of ethics. “**Shall we discuss justice?**” they ask, producing four tiny bites of *jus* to sample—sticky, sweet, salty, and **executive privilege**. Theologians praise moderation with a mouth full of candied sermons. The Royal Academy publishes pamphlets on “The Edibility of Rights,” concluding that liberties are best enjoyed **crumbled** over **consent**.

Every policy has an amuse-bouche; every cruelty has a garnish. Your foreign policy is **salt:** you rub it into neighbors and call it preservation. Your domestic policy is **smoke:** it smells good and makes our eyes water.

The only thing you have not reimagined as cuisine is the truth. Because truth does not plate well. It sits on the tongue like an accusation and refuses to be swallowed without a fight.

---

## VIII. What We Want (Besides to Stop Smelling Tarragon in Our Dreams)

* **Grain, not garnish.** We want the granaries reopened and filled for people, not to stage picturesque backgrounds for pheasant.
* **Budgets that do not caramelize.** Burn the recipes, not the books. Publish accounts on paper that cannot be eaten no matter how desperate a clerk gets.
* **Courts of law, not courts of cuisine.** Let judges bang gavels, not peppermills. Let sentences be written, not iced.
* **An end to Culinary Colonialism.** Stop declaring wars to obtain cinnamon. Your nose is not a compass.
* **A military that sails to defend, not to cater.** Rename *The Appetizer*. For God’s sake, at least call it *The Mains*. (Better: call it **a fleet** and give it cannon that fire iron, not olives.)
* **A palace that can skip a course without collapsing into sobs.** Prove you can govern on an empty plate. Try one council meeting fueled by water and sincerity. If you survive, so will we.

We want you to understand, Majesty, that people do not riot because the cheese is insufficiently aged. They riot because **they are d—n hungry**, because they are tired of standing outside listening to odes to saffron while the cook scrapes quails into barrels the size of our **homes**.

---

## IX. The Bitter Comedy of Being Ruled by Appetite

We are told comedy is a safeguard against tyranny. If so, Your Majesty, you are the safest monarch alive, because we have never laughed so darkly. The jokes write themselves; the kingdom writes petitions like this one because we cannot stop our mouths from running when nothing else in our lives is allowed to move.

We laugh at the map, which a spilled sauce recently turned into a new coastline. We laugh at the **scroll announcing austerity** written in gold leaf on sugared vellum. We laugh at the **Tax on Stomachs** (levied per rumble per day, payable in silence). We laugh until we cry, and then we cry until we remember the tavern’s selling watered sorrow, two cups for a groan.

But here’s the thing about dark humor: it is not a diet. It does not fill the belly. It is spice, nothing more. And you have taught us, thoroughly, that **spice without bread is a prank**.

---

## X. The Raunchy Part You Knew Was Coming (Words You Won’t Find in the Royal Style Guide)

To the **Ministry of Ceremonial Excess**—we know your real name is shorter. We prefer this one. You’re not ministers; you’re decorators with delusions of policy. You keep staging ***theatrical feasts*** as if the world is a damn opera where the chorus can live on applause. Stop rolling your eyes; we can hear it. Your job is not to make the King look good as he chases down another roasted anything. Your job is to make the kingdom **function**.

To the **Guild of Courtiers**, professional nodders, blesser-of-every-bite—you say “How divine!” so often the word has filed a complaint. You have kissed so many rings your lips are permanently shaped like a **seal of approval**. If flattery had calories, you’d feed the nation. You don’t need to stop flattering; you need to redirect it—try praising **competence**. Try applauding **restraint**. Try a standing ovation for **saying ‘no.’**

To the **Royal Cooks** (and may the saints preserve your knives)—this isn’t about you. You keep the palace from collapsing into tantrums. You are heroes with ladles. We want you paid properly and your fires stoked for hospitals, orphanages, army mess halls—yes, and even the castle, because even Kings must eat. But for **mercy’s sake**, can you stop inventing dishes that require a harvest from three continents, a pilgrimage, and the breath of a basilisk.

---

## XI. What Power Looks Like Without the Sauce

Majesty, true power is not a mountain of dishes. True power is a leader who can look at a table groaning with options and say, **“Enough.”** Who can look at a court drunk on spectacle and say **“Sober up—there’s work.”** Who can hear the roar of flattery and ask for **silence**. Who can face a nation with a straight back, empty hands, and a full plan.

True power is a King who can endure a council without dessert. A King who can cancel a gala and schedule a grain convoy with the same flourish of signature. A King who can see his own reflection in the silver and recognize—the horror—the face of a man who must **change**.

Enough with the fireworks over the soup bowls. Enough with the parade of pastries while we bury last year’s debts in this year’s gardens like diseased seeds.

We are not asking for a miracle; we are asking for a menu change.

---

## XII. The Plan (Since Apparently We Have to Write This Too)

1. **Immediate Bread Relief.** Unlock royal grain reserves. If the vault is empty, we’ll unlock the cellars and drink until this seems poetic, but we suggest **not** testing that option. Send wagons. Flour to bakers, not to sculptors who mold baguette into mythological tragedies.
2. **A Budget You Can’t Eat.** New ledgers, ink, signatures. The next clerk who takes a “taste” of a balance sheet will be sentenced to copy the tax codes by hand on sandstone.
3. **Reassign the Master of Revels.** He is now the **Master of Roads.** If he must plan something, let it be bridges; if he needs to pour something, let it be gravel.
4. **De-Sauce the Council.** Water on the table. Bread if we must. Paper and real arithmetic. Every time someone says “mouthfeel,” we fine them a week’s salary and give it to the mills.
5. **Military Reform.** Rename *The Appetizer* to *The Hammer*. Put steel in the holds, not stilton. If an admiral uses the phrase “pairing notes,” he’s demoted to **Shore Leave Scheduling**.
6. **Court Size Reduction.** If a courtier cannot explain their job without saying “ambience,” “aesthetic,” or “terroir,” they get a sabbatical of indefinite length in a town with a broken well to learn **useful words** like “fix” and “soon.”
7. **Harvest Pact.** We sign with our neighbors a pact to keep markets open in bad years. Not a crusade for nutmeg. A **pact**. Not a war, a handshake.
8. **Public Feast Day—After the Famine Is Over.** We are not savages. When this kingdom feeds every belly, we will celebrate with a **single**, magnificent table from north gate to south, and we will clap you on the back and call you the **King Who Learned**. Until then: **work.**

---

## XIII. The Sting in the Tail (Because You Knew There’d Be One)

Majesty, we do not hate you. We are too busy trying not to starve to keep a proper hate garden. But we are furious. We are cracked by it. We are laughing while we break. And we are not confused—**you** are the locus of power, which means **you** are the point of change.

You have surrounded yourself with people who tell you you’re the sun. Newsflash: you’re a candle. Useful, not divine. Bright when tended. Dangerous when you fall over. Replaceable if you insist on setting the curtains ablaze every time you want a little drama.

You want glory? Fine. Great rulers are remembered not for how large their feasts, but how **few** their famines. **Be remembered for canceling a banquet.** Be legendary for closing the wine cellar and opening the granary. Be the monarch who said **“enough”** and meant it.

And if you cannot—if you find that the orchestra drowns out the truth, that the smell of rosemary own your decisions, that the sight of gleaming platters gives you policy amnesia—then by all the saints and all the broken spoons in this suffering country, **we will remember for you**. We will haunt your halls with this letter and a thousand like it. We will recite it under your windows until your sleep smells like onions and accountability.

We reject monarchy-by-menu. We reject governance-by-garnish. Keep your chefs; we want **leaders**.

---

## XIV. Closing Toast (Water Only)

To the day the bell rings for grain, not for dinner.

To the council where the minutes do not have butter fingerprints.

To the map unstained.

To a navy that sails heavy with iron and light with canapés.

To a King who sits at a plain table and says, to the steward, to the chancellor, to the court and the kingdom: **“Enough. Bread first.”**

We will cheer for that King until our throats go hoarse—in a good way, not the way they do now from yelling at tax collectors who insist our pigs owe tariffs on **imaginary truffles**.

Until then, we remain your subjects—sarcastic, stubborn, stomachs growling like wolves in a sermon—armed with pitchforks, yes, but also with pens that will carve this truth into every door from the palace to the pigsty:

**Feed the people, you magnificent, bedazzled banquet-host, or get out of the kitchen of history.**

Signed,
**Every Hungry Mouth That Still Has the Energy to Sign**
(The Bakers’ Guild, The Dockside Mothers, The Night Watch Who Guard Empty Warehouses, The Washerwomen With Stronger Arms Than Your Advisors’ Spines, The Shepherds Who Dream of Bread, The Children Who Learn Numbers by Counting Spoons We Can’t Afford, The Old Soldiers Who Can Tell the Difference Between a Campaign and a Catering Contract, and the Jester—yes, *even the Jester*—who says the joke stopped being funny two winters ago.)

**P.S.** If you find this letter “spicy,” congratulations: it’s the only spice the poor can still afford, and we’ve used it generously. Try pairing it with humility. It has excellent mouthfeel.

**P.P.S.** Do not summon us for a “listening banquet.” Summon the **millers** to the mills, the **carters** to the roads, the **farmers** to fields they can keep, and your royal self to a room without chandeliers where silence is not awkward and truth can be heard. Then, perhaps, we’ll start rebuilding a kingdom that tastes like something other than denial.
